I made a simple way to install a React development invironment on C9. This code was all hand written and de-bugged by me,utilizing a tutorial. The instalation is fast. It only takes 2 terminal commands to install it once you have the Directory structure, and files in C9. This could possibly be installed on your local system with some adjustments to the server ports, and instalation of node and npm.
This work is in no way complete. You may have difficulty with the install. There are many areas in which this can be expanded. Please join in and help if you want to. Thank you.

Once this is installed and running all you have to do is type gulp from the bash terminal.

Typing gulp will Compile React JSX, Lint JSX and JS with ESlint, Bundle your JS and CSS files, Migrate the built app to the dist folder, and run a dev web-server.

These Following bash terminal commands may get your app dev environment started. After you have the files installed.

    Install from the bash terminal in cloud nine.
    npm install
    From the bash terminal in cloud nine type 
    gulp
    If everything went well the server should be running.
    In the C9 preview you should see the demo app running.
    Also if you save a changed file you can see the file being
    Linted with ESlint in the terminal window. Helping to de-bug.
    Also if you open the preview address in another browser.
    And push the f12 button, you will find helpfull out put
    in console.
    Happy coding!
